          <h2>Preclinical Stage: How will this vaccine work?</h2>
          <p>This research-intensive stage is designed to find natural or synthetic antigens—foreign substances that induce an immune reaction in your body—that trigger the same reaction an actual virus or bacteria would. Identifying the right antigen or antigens can often take up to four years.</p>
        <p>Janssen already has a tested vaccine technology platform, called AdVac®, that’s been used in its Ebola vaccine, as well as investigational vaccines for HIV and RSV. The AdVac “viral vector”—a version of adenovirus 26 (Ad26), which normally causes common colds, but that’s been disabled so it can’t make you sick—transports part of a pathogen's genetic code into the body. This stimulates the immune system to fight the disease caused by the virus so that you develop immunity to that disease without actually developing the disease itself.</p>

          <h2>Phases 1/2a and 2b: Is it safe, and what's the right dose?</h2>
          <p>Phase 1 testing marks the first time the vaccine is tested in a small group of adults, usually between 20 to 80 people, to evaluate its safety and measure the immune response it generates. Phase 2a studies aim to determine the most effective dose, and expand the safety experience with the vaccine.</p>  
          <p>Researchers look for expected reactions to the vaccine—which could include anticipated adverse events, like headache, muscle pain, redness and swelling at the injection site or low-grade fevers—as well as serious adverse events, which are expected to be rare, over the entire duration of the study.

            “We want to make sure that when it comes to safety, we’re taking precautions,” Dr. Douoguih says.
            
            Phase 1 and 2a clinical trials normally last several months to even a year before proceeding to Phase 2b or Phase 3 trials, in which the pool of people receiving the vaccine increases.</p>

          <h2>Phase 3: How effective is the vaccine?</h2>
        <p>In this stage of the clinical trial, even more volunteers receive the vaccine to study whether it's effective.

          This month, Janssen scientists plan to administer the investigational SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to tens of thousands of healthy people, as well as those particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 in areas where the highest rates of viral transmission are.</p>  
        <p>In preparation for this phase of the study, Janssen worked with leading epidemiologists and modelers around the world to predict these hot spots.</p>

          <h2>Regulatory approval and licensure: Is it ready for the world?</h2>
          <p>After a successful Phase 3 trial, vaccine manufacturers submit an application to regulatory bodies such as the European Commission or the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). At this stage, clinical trial data is reviewed to make sure the vaccine is safe and effective.</p>
          <p>Once the vaccine is approved, enough of the product needs to be manufactured to immunize those who need it. And in this case, Janssen will need to demonstrate that it can provide a supply of doses worldwide to the public, including underserved populations, on a not-for-profit basis for emergency pandemic use—a commitment it made in March as part of a landmark partnership with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Association (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services.</p>

          <h2>Phase 4: Will it stay safe down the road?</h2>
          <p>Even after the vaccine is approved and licensed, regulatory agencies stay involved, continuing to monitor production; inspecting manufacturing facilities; and testing vaccines for potency, safety and purity.</p>  
          <p>The FDA also monitors adverse events that may occur related to receiving the vaccine, including through its Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and Phase 4 clinical trials—optional studies pharmaceutical companies may be required to perform after a vaccine is licensed to continue to monitor safety and effectiveness.

            The end result: A potentially life-saving vaccine for COVID-19 that’s “been developed in months, which is something that, up until now, has been virtually unheard of,” Dr. Redlich says. “But there is an urgent medical need for us to do this, and do it safely.”</p>
